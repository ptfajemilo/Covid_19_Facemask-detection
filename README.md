# Covid_19_Facemask-detection
Facemask detection is an example of computer vision project. The dataset of those putting on facemask and those who do not put it on was obtained from Kaggle.
The dataset was divided into training and testing data set and was subjected to Convolution neural network model. Due to the large data and limited processor. The data training was done for two epochs. The degree of accuracy ia about 98%. I believed the model can further be improved upon and also used for some other image processing project.
